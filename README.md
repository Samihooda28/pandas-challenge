OBSERVABLE TREND

The dataset got total of 15 schools and  39,170 students. Average reading score for total students is 69.98 which is lower than the average math score 70.33. the passing rate for maths (86.07 %) has a higher rate than reading (84.42 % ),the overall passing rate is 72.80%. These findings indicate that student's score more in math than reading.

The school summary finding showed that out of 15 school there are 8 of independent level and 7 of government level. The number of students in schools ranged between 427 students (Holden High School) to 4976 students (Bailey High School). In the school summary Total School Budget tells you the total money spent.Bailey High SChool spent the most money($3,124,928) as it got highest number of students also whereas Holden High School spent less money ($248,087) as it got less number of students. Huang High School spent most money per student ($655.00). Huang High School is one of the bottom performing school the same as Bailey High School it one area for future improvement to see education quality as it budgeted . From the school summary we can tell that government school spend more money than the independent school. However, if we per student budget indpendent school spent more money as compared to government school. 

Griffin High School got the best overall passing percentage (81.33%) whereas Hernandez High School is the worst performing school. If we see data most of the governmnet school performed worst as compared to the independent schools.

Observations:-

The other irregular finding of this analysis is that when the budget per student increases student's average math score, the average reading score, percent of passing math, percent of passing reading, and the overall passing decreases. This finding commences investigating the real motivators for academic achievement, and give an open space for researchers to work on this more.

The data revealed that when the number of students sizes higher in schools the average math scores, average reading scores, passing math, passing reading, and overall passing decrease. So, we can infer that, when student size rises, it negatively influences student achievement. Therefore, government and independent school should work on student size in schools, and classes because it directly affects student achievement for so many reasons.
